# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is CKodes's solution to the  [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc). This solution was completed **without using the Bootstrap framework**.

Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- HTML | CSS

### Continued development

- Refactor code. I feel like there is too many CSS.

### Useful resources

[Google Extensions: ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en)
- I did not have access to the Figma files for this solution and the colors on the free starter files seemed off so I used this tool to find the closest matching color to the design.
